University of Alberta Winter 2016 CMPUT 301 Group project.

An Android application to rent and borrow all the stuff you need. 

Renters

Take a picture of what you want to rent out, give it a spiffy title, provide a description, and papaya will find a nearby renter who will give you cash fast to borrow your stuff.

Borrowers
---------
Type in some keywords and papaya will find in your area what you are looking for. See a picture of it so you know what you are getting. Place a bid, and soon you will have an affordible item in your hands to use.
